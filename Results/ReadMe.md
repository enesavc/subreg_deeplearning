This folder contains some partial results, for more information about the results please refer to the research paper, https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05940.

Here we report partial results of some RNNs runs. After each epoch, the RNNs were tested on the test sets. Inspection of the accuracy trajectories indicate that accuracy had stabilized in all cases well before the 100th epoch. Therefore, accuracy results are reported after the 100th epoch of training. The networks were run 10 times and we report the mean accuracy results on each test set, along with the standard deviation.

There are four files in this folder, each of which show the results of the mean accuracy results on each test set
