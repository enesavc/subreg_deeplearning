Results

Here we report partial results of some RNNs runs. After each epoch, the RNNs were tested on the
test sets. Inspection of the accuracy trajectories indicate that accuracy had stabilized in all cases
well before the 100th epoch. Therefore, accuracy
results are reported after the 100th epoch of training.
The networks were run 10 times and we report
the mean accuracy results on each test set, along
with the standard deviation.
