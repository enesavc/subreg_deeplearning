This folder contains three RNN codes and one folder that contains the information to run the RPNI and check its accuracy on target stringsets:

a. LSTM code

b. sRNN that uses ADAM as an optimization algorithm

c. sRNN that uses SGD as an optimization algorithm

d. RPNI Folder

  (i). RPNI Code (MatLab)
  
  (ii). RPNI_OUTPUT (MatLab)
  
  (iii). Foma Code that test RPNI Accuracy
